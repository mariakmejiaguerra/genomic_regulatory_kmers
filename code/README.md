## kmergrammar
### **Kmergrammar - regulatory grammar of the k-mers - **
Kmergrammar has been designed to explore functional genomic information, such as MNAse-seq, ATAC-seq, or ChIP-seq
aimed to extract sequence features that are signatures of the regions characterized for such biochemical assays.
Further, Kmergrammar allows sequence augmentation, from the adding of information such as
Genetic Variation (i.e., MAF scores), or DNA conservation (i.e., GERP scores)
